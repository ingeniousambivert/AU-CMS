      "details": "Energy of the students was at the utmost level as it was the first industrial visit of AIChE Ahmedabad University. We have shown the outline of the Narayan industry so that students understand in better way and solve their doubts during the industrial visit. The reason why we have set this industrial visit was that students had perform few experiments on dye during their academy year and we want to show them in the large scale. We want our students to know the importance, classification and uses of dye. On the day of the industrial visit it was great to see massive response from the students. Students had taken major initiative to learn about industry and process. Industrial visit had completed smoothly and students had learned a lot from this visit.",
